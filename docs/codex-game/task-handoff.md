# Codex Task Handoff

## Active task

- Status: `IMPLEMENTED_NEEDS_VERIFICATION`
- Started: 2026-10-19
- Last updated: 2026-10-19
- Original user wording: "броня має бути бронею, її mesh не повинен потрапляти в список деталей робота й ніколи не має ставати видимим; він потрібен тільки для редагування броні"
- Objective: exclude all armor mesh objects from robot death debris and remove debris physics from editor-only armor meshes.

### Acceptance criteria

1. `DeathLogic.detachableVisuals` contains no object whose hierarchy is under `Armor`.
2. Armor mesh objects remain editor-only and do not receive debris `Rigidbody` or `MeshCollider` components.
3. Armor colliders and armor-controller references remain unchanged.
4. All eight registered IA/NV prefabs pass integrity validation.

### Work recorded

- Removed 56 armor mesh objects from `DeathLogic.detachableVisuals` across the eight registered IA/NV prefabs.
- Removed the 112 debris `Rigidbody`/`MeshCollider` components previously added to those armor mesh objects; armor collider arrays and controller references were left unchanged.
- Updated `robot-control.md` and `weapons-damage.md` to document armor as editor-only geometry excluded from death debris.

### Verification

- Static scan confirms all armor paths have zero debris physics and zero `DeathLogic.detachableVisuals` entries.
- Static scan confirms non-armor debris counts remain aligned: each configured death entry has a kinematic `Rigidbody` and convex `MeshCollider`; legacy arrays remain empty.
- Removed component IDs have no remaining serialized references, so armor controller and armor collider bindings are not dangling.
- The open Unity editor reimported the changed prefab assets without compiler errors; full integrity menu validation after this cleanup remains pending.

### Remaining work

- Reimport changed prefabs and run the registered-prefab integrity validation.

## Previous completed task (mesh debris physics)

- Status: `IMPLEMENTED_NEEDS_VERIFICATION`
- Started: 2026-10-19
- Last updated: 2026-10-19
- Original user wording: "видали ріджід баді з усіх парентів мешів, прибери вимкнені меш колайдери, додай Rigidbody і convex MeshCollider на всі об'єкти з MeshRenderer та активуй саме ці об'єкти при знищенні"
- Objective: rebuild robot death debris so each rendered mesh object owns its own disabled-kinematic Rigidbody and convex MeshCollider, and DeathLogic activates those objects on destruction.

### Acceptance criteria

1. Registered IA and NV robot prefabs no longer use Rigidbody/MeshCollider on obsolete mesh parents.
2. Every configured death debris object with a MeshRenderer has a kinematic Rigidbody and a convex MeshCollider while alive.
3. DeathLogic activates the configured mesh debris objects when the robot dies and no longer depends on the removed parent-level physics objects.
4. Existing visual/death timing behavior remains intact and prefab references are valid.

### Assumptions

- The change applies to the eight registered IA/NV robot prefabs and their existing configured/legacy debris lists.
- Existing visual meshes and transforms are preserved; only physics ownership and serialized debris references are rebuilt.
- No compatibility path for the obsolete parent-level physics setup is required.

### Work recorded

- Rebuilt all eight registered IA/NV robot prefabs so every `MeshRenderer` object owns a disabled convex `MeshCollider` and kinematic `Rigidbody` using its own `MeshFilter.sharedMesh`.
- Removed non-renderer parent-level `Rigidbody` and `MeshCollider` components and cleared the legacy parallel debris arrays.
- Rebuilt `DeathLogic.detachableVisuals` with one entry per mesh-renderer object and updated `robot-control.md` and `weapons-damage.md` to document the new ownership contract.

### Verification

- Isolated Unity batch migration imported all eight prefabs successfully and saved 153 configured non-armor mesh debris objects.
- Static prefab scan passed: `MeshRenderer`, `Rigidbody`, `MeshCollider`, convex, kinematic, and non-null `DeathLogic` entry counts match for every registered prefab.
- `Game.Scripts.Editor.VehiclePrefabIntegrityBatch.RepairAndValidate` passed for all 8 registered prefabs with zero repairs and zero validation errors.
- The open Unity editor reimported the changed prefab assets and completed script compilation without compiler errors.
- Unity emitted 14 convex-hull polygon-limit warnings for high-poly meshes; Unity still created partial convex hulls as requested. Play Mode death behavior remains pending.

### Remaining work

- Let the open Unity editor reimport the eight changed prefab files.
- Run a Play Mode death test and confirm each mesh object detaches, renders, and fades without parent-level physics or missing references.

This is the durable state for one active Codex task. A new Codex chat must read this file and inspect the working-tree changes before acting on a request to continue.

## Previous completed task (settings)

- Status: `COMPLETED`
- Started: 2026-10-19
- Last updated: 2026-10-19
- Original user wording: "глянь сетінги, продивися код, ссилки, як все налаштовано та реалізовано, і запрограмуй так щоб кнопка аплай була активна тільки тоді коли дійсно щось треба аплаїти, в інших випадках вона не активна, це про сетінги відео."
- Objective: keep the Video settings Apply button disabled until a real video-setting change is pending.

### Acceptance criteria

1. Video Apply is disabled on initial load when controls match the applied baseline.
2. Changing any Video dropdown, VSync toggle, or Gamma slider enables Apply.
3. Reverting controls to the baseline or applying changes disables Apply again.
4. Existing settings controller behavior and non-Video tab Apply behavior remain wired.

### Assumptions

- The applied Video values are represented by the controls populated in `VideoTabView.SetData`, so the baseline is captured from those controls after initialization.
- `SettingsController` continues to update the model immediately; Apply remains the point that persists and applies Video values.
- The existing non-Video tabs keep their current Apply behavior; this task changes only Video pending-state feedback.

### Work recorded

- Added a Video-settings baseline snapshot and `PendingChangesChanged` event to `VideoTabView`.
- Added listener cleanup before rebinding, change notifications for every Video control, and baseline refresh after Apply.
- Updated `SettingsView` to subscribe to the Video pending-state event and drive `ApplyButton.interactable` from the current Video baseline.
- Updated `menus-settings-progression.md` with the Apply-state ownership and lifecycle.

### Verification

- `git diff --check` passed for the two changed settings scripts.
- Unity recompiled without a visible compile-error modal.
- Play Mode with `ClientMenuTestMode`: initial Video Apply was disabled; changing Quality to Balanced enabled it; Apply disabled it after saving; changing back to High Fidelity enabled it again; applying once more disabled it.
- Play Mode was stopped after verification; no scene changes were saved.

### Remaining work

None.

## Completed task history

### Video settings Apply pending-state tracking — completed

- `VideoTabView` now owns the applied Video baseline and reports whether dropdown, VSync, or Gamma values differ from it.
- `SettingsView` updates the serialized Apply button from that state and refreshes the baseline after Video Apply.
- Verified the disabled → enabled → disabled lifecycle in Play Mode with `ClientMenuTestMode`.

### First vertical anchor correction — superseded by current hierarchy diagnostic

- Set all five template-item rects to top vertical anchors while preserving the existing horizontal stretch and 36-pixel row height.
- Initial Play Mode testing appeared improved, but the user's follow-up screenshot shows the first option still clipped and unused backing height below the list; the correction is therefore not accepted as final.

### TMP dropdown rebuild and first visibility repair — completed before current geometry follow-up

- Rebuilt the one Free XP and four Video settings selectors as inspector-wired `TMP_Dropdown` controls, preserving existing artwork, sizes, text, settings effects, and listeners.
- Fixed template validation by keeping every template-item `Toggle` active beneath its inactive `Template`; fixed invisible rows by stretching their horizontal anchors from `x: 0` to `1`.
- Removed the obsolete custom option scripts and references; static scans, compilation, and initial Play Mode selection/list-blocker checks passed.
- The current task follows a later screenshot that exposes the remaining vertical-template offset.

### Settings dropdown Free XP visual clone — superseded by stable TMP rebuild

- Rebuilt the four Video settings controls as custom Free XP-style button/list dropdowns and preserved their value events and VSync frame-rate disabling.
- Static checks and C# build passed, but runtime review found that multiple lists could stay open and list backing height was fixed; this implementation is now intentionally replaced by the active task.

### Settings dropdown behavior migration — superseded

- Replaced four Video `TMP_Dropdown` controls with `SettingsDropdown` and `SettingsDropdownOption` while keeping existing setting events.
- This custom implementation is obsolete under the active project-wide TMP rebuild.

### Free XP dropdown — incorrect inferred refactor discarded

- The Free XP selector was temporarily converted after an inferred request, then restored when the user clarified Free XP was the desired visual reference.

### Post-battle rewards — implementation complete, deployment and match verification pending

- Persisted and returned Bolts/Free XP reward amounts, routed their authoritative availability through the result popup, and documented the result flow.
- Builds and payload mapping checks passed; pending: deploy the API migration and verify a completed live match.

### Procedural sniper scope mask — implementation complete, visual zoom check deferred

- Replaced `Hud_Aim_Bracket.png` with `ProceduralSniperScopeMask.shader` and its material; `Client.unity/SniperScopeMask` has no sprite and uses a full-screen procedural circular aperture.
- Unity imported the shader/material without compiler errors; pending: match visual verification.

### Main-menu robot-card scrolling and preview stability — closed by user without Play Mode verification

- `Client.unity` includes a horizontal robot-card `ScrollRect`; `RobotView` preserves position while refreshing cards.
- Automated checks passed; required Play Mode checks were closed by user before beginning subsequent work.
